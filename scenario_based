1)You have an ansible playbook that configures a server with a specific package. You want to run the playbook on a group of servers, but you want to skip the task that installs the package on a specific server. How would you do this?

You can achieve this by using Ansible's `when` condition to skip the task based on a condition. Here's an example:

```yaml
- name: Install package
  hosts: your_server_group
  tasks:
    - name: Install package
      package:
        name: your_package
        state: present
      when: inventory_hostname != 'specific_server'
```

In this example, replace `your_server_group` with the group of servers you want to configure and replace `specific_server` with the name of the server where you want to skip the package installation task. This condition (`when: inventory_hostname != 'specific_server'`) will skip the task when the playbook is run on the `specific_server` but will execute it on all other servers in the group.
